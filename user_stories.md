As a computer science student using the review website, after submitting my review, I want to be able to view, edit, or delete the content of my review. Currently, this functionality is not available on the website. 
After I submit a review, there should be an option in the user dashboard to view my submitted reviews. When I select a specific review, I should be able to see the review content along with the title and any associated details.
I should have the option to edit the review, including modifying the title and content. I should also be able to delete the review if I decide to remove it from the system.
