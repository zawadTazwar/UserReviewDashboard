### Team Review

**Mahad's review:**

Working with this team has been a positive experience characterized by everyone's strong work ethic and commitment to the project's success. I haven't encountered any significant issues during our collaboration. While we did face some challenges related to project deadlines coinciding with midterms, these were situational and not anyone's fault.

Here are brief reviews of each team member:

Jason Wheeler:
Jason has been a pleasure to work with. He's been very helpful in clarifying tasks and goes the extra mile to discuss and solve problems outside of class. He's quick to respond and gets work done efficiently. Jason's extensive knowledge in various programming languages has been a valuable asset. He also played a key role in designing the framework and helping with tasks related to HTML and CSS.

Zawad:
Zawad is a hardworking team member with a cheerful personality. While he sometimes faced challenges understanding tasks, he compensated for it through sheer hard work. He's always willing to meet outside of class for collaborative work. Although he fell behind a bit during midterms, he managed to catch up and complete his tasks successfully.

Md Gulam Mahmud:
Md Gulam Mahmud is a quiet but knowledgeable team member. He regularly organizes meetings outside of class to discuss his work and is a valuable resource for code discussions. He's actively engaged online and maintains regular communication through our group chat on Discord.

In summary, it's been a pleasure working with this diligent team. Challenges were met with resilience and collaboration. I look forward to achieving more together.
