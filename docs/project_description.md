Project Description COMP2005, Fall 2023

As part of the software process, it is usual to include a performance review of how well the team is doing and how well 
individuals are contributing to the project. During your project, every team member is expected to conduct performance reviews as well as be 
the subject of performance reviews. 

The project is to build a performance review web-based application, to support and performance review activity 
as well as maintain the review data and information.

You are not expected to use the tool you develop for your project reviews, since it will not be
fully functional at first, you cannot use it for your earliest reviews in any case.

As an illustration, here is some functionality a performance review tool might encompass:

* Set up a schedule of reviews to be conducted. Scheduled reviews can be checked to see if they are complete or not.
* Topic of a review could be individual performance or team performance
* Each registered user can access their own reviews, or enter new reviews
* Reviews may be structured into headings
* Reviews may use a checklist
* A user can start a draft review and return to it later before submitting a final draft
* Reviews could be published to other registered users
* A review could be published with the authors identity, or could be published anonymously 
* All reviews of a specific topic could be aggregated so the results can be seen collectively

More possible features of the tool will be generated by your team as the project progresses.
