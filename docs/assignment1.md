# Assignment 1 , CS2005 F2023

This outlines how credit will be evaluated for assignment 1 - the first development cycle - of the project.
Specific activities and tasks to be undertaken will be posted under meeting agendas corresponding to classroom sessions
on the course web page. They may not be complete during the meeting, but they should be discussed and
assigned with an expected completion time during team meetings.

At the end of the first assignment / first iteration of the project, the team should have a minimal working server
implementation in which a user can log on; draft a review for a topic, where a topic can be a piece of work with an
assigned worker; return to and modify a draft review at a later time; publish the review to other team members;
and view published reviews by topic.

Your team will also be required to submit five (or fewer, based on the number of team members) user stories with new
proposed functional requirements to be

Features added for credit to the project are subject to the instructor's approval. In later iterations will add features
proposed by your team.

## Individual/Assignment Submission

* Grade is based on the individual programming tasks assigned to you in team meetings, and your participation in team
  activity.
* At least two development/coding tasks
  should be assigned to each team member by the team for the first iteration/cycle/assignment.
* Only the component merged into the main/master branch/trunk of the project repo will be evaluated
  * Submission must be approved as a pull request using team approved source management strategy.
  * Pull and merge to master/main branch must be conducted per the team imposed deadline to qualify for evaluation.
* For coding tasks, the following will be included in the grade assessment:
  * Personal and team evaluation of the current state of the code implementation will be part of submission
  * Code review by the entire team
  * Application of code design principles discussed in class materials, notes and videos (starting with notes 8 and 9)
  * Proper docstrings
  * Delivery of unit tests
    * we do not have time for complete coverage in this course, but each method call should have minimum of one success mode test and one failure mode test
* For individual contribution to the team activity, the following will contribute to the grade assessment:
  * Reasonable effort expended for the course time commitment
  * Attendance and Participation in team meetings. Taking turns as note taker and SCRUM master.
  * Performance review by the entire team
  * Participation in code and performance reviews

## Team/Group submission

* The README file in your repo will be read by the evaluator to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. The current state of development (what works and how to use it) should be clear to the reader.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, should reflect team progress on the project
  * Other required documents are in the documents folder in your repo
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

Team submission evaluation will be based on practicing certain elements in the development process:
* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings according to the class schedule with all decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board and the issue tracker
  * Architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented.
  * New Features broken into tasks. Coding tasks assigned to individual team members.
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board on your team github page and the issue tracker in your project repository
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first cycle. Establish labels, color coding, and categories for the Kanban board cards and issues. Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for assignment 1, and assigned tasks.
  * Performance reviews (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented
    * I expect serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility.
    * any problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented
  * Code reviews conducted and documented.
    * Code should be discussed at SCRUM meetings, which discussion can produce material for the end-of-cycle code review. A member presents their code, and everyone in the team should understand it.
  * Pull request deadlines established and enforced.  You are not doing a team member a favor by
    * documentation, Kanban Board and issue tracker
      * labels and organization of issues in the tracker and cards on the board should be clear to the evaluator.
    * individual task assignment
  * For cycle 1 only: user stories and new feature requirement suggestions. One story per team member, yielding at least two suggested requirements each.
