## Team Review

### Mahad's Team Review:

The semester is finally coming to a close and I can say that working with this team has been a great learning experience for me. I have learnt a lot
over these past few months and despite a few hiccups here and there, the team has come a long way since the first sprint. We work together very efficiently now and
if given the chance I would love to work with all of these guys again in the future as well.

Jason: Jason has been the leader of this team and has always taken an initiative with distributing tasks and getting things done. He always does his best to ensure everyone is on the same page 
and goes out of his way to help out each one of us. Being very honest I don't think Jason had any issues whatsoever this sprint, the only thing being of concern was a few days where he was unable to get work done due
to extreme workload outside of school and other courses. However, that was not an issue either given that the professor extended the deadline for the final sprint. Jason has been very active on discord as well and
always does his best to prepare for meetings beforehand so, he can ensure that everyone knows what they are doing. He has been this team's backbone and I believe that he will reach great heights in the future.

Zawad: Zawad has definitely shown the most improvement out of all members of this team. He was more regular in meetings and tried to be more interactive. He got all of his tasks done, but was a little behind the schedule we discussed, but again the professor
extended the deadline so, it worked out in the end. The only thing I feel he lacked was taking an initiative with tasks he wanted to do. He did do everything assigned to him, but he never pointed out that he wanted to do something which he was particularly interested in
or wanted to learn about. However, Jason was good with task division and I feel like everyone got to do a bit of everything and I believe Zawad feels the same way.

Md Gulam Mahmud Chowdhury (Dayeem): As I have always said Dayeem is this teams most punctual member and never disappoints us. He always pulls through with tasks and has definitely been 
more involved in the decision making process compared to earlier sprints. He blended together with the team more comfortably and got his tasks done flawlessly. Again the only problem, being extremely honest, we faced was that he ran a little bit behind our discussed schedule,
 but everything worked out with the professor providing us an extenison.

All in all, it has been an absolute pleasure working with these people and I wish them all the best for the future.

### Jason's Team Review:

**Team:**
The team has worked great together since the beginning. I feel like we came together and built a great first project for some of us. It was fun to build and fun to learn how to work as a team.

**Md Golam Mahmud (Dayeem):**
Dayeem has been great to work with, he always shows up to meetings on time and works hard on his tasks assigned to him.
Only suggestion for dayeem in the future would to be more vocal and also be more of a leader. I feel like he has the skills, just needs to confidence. Other than that, Dayeem has been a pleasure to work with. 

**Mahad:**
Mahad is great. He came up with a really good feature idea for this sprint and executed it very well. Still having a similar issue with not showing up to meetings on time though. It causes a slow down with our meetings and meetingnotes because we need the whole teams impact which results from us talking on discord more.

**Zawad (Tazwar):**
Zawad came up with a great idea for a feature this sprint. He did a great job on it as well, and I am happy with his work throughout the course. I gave him a bigger task of the microservices document and he did it very well.
Still having an issue with showing up on time for meetings though. And I would have liked his coding portion done sooner when the rest of us were working on ours. It would have allowed him to help with more documentation.

### Jawad's Team Review:
It has been a great experience to work as a team in this course. Learned a lot of things which improved me socially and personally. Each team member has performed exceptionally well. The last sprint and this sprint was really packed with true team effort. I really feel fortunate to have been a part of such a great group.
Now some words for my teammates:


**Jason:**
Jason is a great team leader, organizing tasks well and preparing thoroughly for meetings, which has really helped the team. His personal meetings with the course professor also cleared out a lot of doubts. But sometimes his other commitments affected his work with the team. It would be good if he shared tasks with others more.

**Dayeem:**
Dayeem is always on time and does his tasks well. He's good at making decisions and fits in well with the team. Although, he should try to finish tasks on the original schedule, even though he managed okay with the extended deadlines.

**Mahad:**
Mahad has good technical skills and his ideas for the project are really helpful. But he needs to be on time for meetings to help the team run smoothly.
