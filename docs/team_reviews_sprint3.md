## Team Review

### Mahad's Team Review:

The semester is finally coming to a close and I can say that working with this team has been a great learning experience for me. I have learnt a lot
over these past few months and despite a few hiccups here and there, the team has come a long way since the first sprint. We work together very efficiently now and
if given the chance I would love to work with all of these guys again in the future as well.

Jason: Jason has been the leader of this team and has always taken an initiative with distributing tasks and getting things done. He always does his best to ensure everyone is on the same page 
and goes out of his way to help out each one of us. Being very honest I don't think Jason had any issues whatsoever this sprint, the only thing being of concern was a few days where he was unable to get work done due
to extreme workload outside of school and other courses. However, that was not an issue either given that the professor extended the deadline for the final sprint. Jason has been very active on discord as well and
always does his best to prepare for meetings beforehand so, he can ensure that everyone knows what they are doing. He has been this team's backbone and I believe that he will reach great heights in the future.

Zawad: Zawad has definitely shown the most improvement out of all members of this team. He was more regular in meetings and tried to be more interactive. He got all of his tasks done, but was a little behind the schedule we discussed, but again the professor
extended the deadline so, it worked out in the end. The only thing I feel he lacked was taking an initiative with tasks he wanted to do. He did do everything assigned to him, but he never pointed out that he wanted to do something which he was particularly interested in
or wanted to learn about. However, Jason was good with task division and I feel like everyone got to do a bit of everything and I believe Zawad feels the same way.

Md Gulam Mahmud Chowdhury (Dayeem): As I have always said Dayeem is this teams most punctual member and never disappoints us. He always pulls through with tasks and has definitely been 
more involved in the decision making process compared to earlier sprints. He blended together with the team more comfortably and got his tasks done flawlessly. Again the only problem, being extremely honest, we faced was that he ran a little bit behind our discussed schedule,
 but everything worked out with the professor providing us an extenison.

All in all, it has been an absolute pleasure working with these people and I wish them all the best for the future.
