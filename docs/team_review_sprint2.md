### Team Review

**Mahad's review:**
As another sprint comes to an end, I can say again that this team has been a pleasure to work with. We are collaborating
much better compared to sprint 1 and feel more confident about the project and relevant documentation. Below I discuss
how I found working with each individual to be like.

Jason: Jason has been amazing to work with he took the lead in refining our process model and was very helpful in designing the frontend.
At times however, Jason takes on tasks that were supposed to be taken on by other teammates as well, which while helps the process to move
along more smoothly hampers the growth of the person in terms of learning. However, I believe he has been crucial to this team and I look
forward to working with him in the future as well.

Zawad: Zawad takes on all tasks and has always done his best to get them done. However, at times outside of meetings he tends to be unresponsive and is hard to 
reach. However, he improved towards the end of the sprint and has been an integral part of the team.

Md Gulam Mahmud Chowdhury (Dayeem): Dayeem is our most punctual member and as I said in the last review, he is always the 
first one to show up to meetings, always available outside of class too to work on the project. However, at times he delays work
submission which slows down our process, but he also works outside of school, so we all understand. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to work
with him again as well.
