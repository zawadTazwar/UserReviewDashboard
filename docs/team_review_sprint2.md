## Team Review

### Mahad's Team Review:

As another sprint comes to an end, I can say again that this team has been a pleasure to work with. We are collaborating
much better compared to sprint 1 and feel more confident about the project and relevant documentation. Below I discuss
how I found working with each individual to be like.

Jason: Jason has been amazing to work with he took the lead in refining our process model and was very helpful in designing the frontend.
At times however, Jason takes on tasks that were supposed to be taken on by other teammates as well, which while helps the process to move
along more smoothly hampers the growth of the person in terms of learning. However, I believe he has been crucial to this team and I look
forward to working with him in the future as well.

Zawad: Zawad takes on all tasks and has always done his best to get them done. However, at times outside of meetings he tends to be unresponsive and is hard to 
reach. However, he improved towards the end of the sprint and has been an integral part of the team.

Md Gulam Mahmud Chowdhury (Dayeem): Dayeem is our most punctual member and as I said in the last review, he is always the 
first one to show up to meetings, always available outside of class too to work on the project. However, at times he delays work
submission which slows down our process, but he also works outside of school, so we all understand. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to work
with him again as well.

### Md Golam Mahmud's Team Review:

In this sprint, our team experienced a dynamic blend of challenges and accomplishments. Each team member's unique contributions played a vital role in shaping our progress. Here's a snapshot of my team member's performances:

**Jason:**
Jason has demonstrated exceptional adaptability in tackling diverse tasks. His attempt to achieving goals for the sprint has been remarkable. Mainly the teams progress tracker was him.
He managed to divide tasks between the team members as he could acknowledge the potentials of other members. His contribution to the organization of the documentation has immensely been beneficial to the teams progress.

Challenges: 
Jason tends to work many tasks at a time. It's hard to keep up with him, as finishing a task and then assessing it before starting another is crucial for an efficient task completion.

Response: 
Consequently we implemented tasks scheduling on the KanBan board. Time reinforced for a specific task on the members and adequate time allocation was administered.
Different tasks after execution were reviewed and reassessed multiple times by the members to increase code and modelling correction.
Frequent communication on team constraints on assessment of the code and next task allocation was done through the discord team server to manage project goals.

**Mahad:**
Mahad's technical expertise and attention to detail were irrefutable. His ability to navigate complex issues and provide well-thought-out solutions contributed to the overall efficiency of the team. He kept up with the pace better than anyone.

Challenges: 
His communication was confined to one group member at a time.
Sometimes late in meetings due to personal household aspects.

Response:
Setting up collaborative tasks with Mahad with other group members to extend teamwork. 
Making one-to-one communication with Mahad in the discord server.
Meeting note takers' follow-up with each team member after each meeting to ensure, nothing's missed throughout the project phase.

**Zawad:**
Zawad's task completion efficiency is invariably appreciated. His work is always done before the due time. 
Zawad's positive and lively demeanor, coupled with his consistent contribution, has served as a motivating factor for the entire team.

Challenges:
Zawad was not consistent in contribution. He was not assigned tasks regularly as of other members. Also has to do with the fault in team dynamics and not just him.
Sometimes not very clear on what the meeting agendas are. 

Response: 
Zawad is given harder aspects of the coding.
Made to do complex and extensive work required documentations.

### Jason's Team Review:

**Team:**
The team has worked great together since the beginning. We always get our work done and our personalities have came together very nicely.
I want to see this team work together on assigning tasks, team meetings, and discord discussions better. I tend to take a more leadership role which is fine, I do feel like a team needs someone to be in that position. Although this tends to cause team members to rely on me for running everything.
This often means I am the only team member that familiarizes myself with the meeting agenda before we start our meeting. As well as, I am often the only member that reads up on the professors material for the tasks to be assigned.
Our meetings have only 50 minutes, and we need to get as much done in that meeting as possible instead of myself explaining what could have been read on the course webpage beforehand.
This can be improved by everyone taking more initiative on what the professor assigns us to do. If we all come prepared with ideas, questions, and thoughts our team meeting process and understanding of the project will be improved by everyone.

**Md Golam Mahmud (Dayeem):**
Dayeem has been great to work with, he always shows up to meetings on time and works hard on his tasks assigned to him.
I want Dayeem to take the feedback we talked about in the meetings and continue to work on communicating issues with tasks assigned and completing these tasks on time.
He has improved toward the end of the sprint and I hope this continues.

**Mahad:**
Mahad is great at working on tasks. I tend to assign him harder tasks then other team members because he continues to do a great job on them. 
I would like to see some more effort with the team meetings from Mahad. He often shows up late and isn't prepared for the meeting agenda.
The best way to improve would be to come on time and read the agenda tasks the professor has assigned on the course webpage and think about questions and ideas for those agenda items beforehand.

**Zawad (Tazwar):**
Zawad is always smiling with a good attitude. He is open to taking on whatever may be assigned to him.
I would like to see Zawad show up for team meetings on time more often and talk more in the meetings. We don't get a lot of responses or ideas from Zawad which needs to be improved.
This can happen by being more involved with the team on discord, showing to meetings on time, and being more vocal about his thoughts.

### Zawad's Team Review:
It has been a great experience to work on a project with a group as this was my first group project at MUN. Got the chance to learn a lot from my team members and still learning. 
Some words for my team members:
**Jason:**
Jason is a strong and active leader who is good at handling different tasks and leading the team. However, his strong role sometimes makes other team members depend too much on him, which might not be good for their learning. He is really good at organizing tasks and keeping track of the team's progress, but it would be better if he encouraged others to take more responsibility and shared tasks more evenly.

**Mahad:**
Mahad is really skilled technically and pays great attention to details, which really helps the team work wel. It would also help if he came to meetings on time and was more prepared to discuss what the team needs to do.

**Dayeem:**
Dayeem is always on time and consistently shows up for team meetings, showing he's really committed. He works hard on what he's given, but he should try to finish his work faster and talk more about any problems he's facing. This would help the team work together better and keep the project moving smoothly.
