## 1. Introduction
This document outlines our source control strategy for managing code and collaborating using Git.

## 2. Version Control System
- We use Git as our version control system for tracking changes in our codebase.

## 3. Repository Structure
- Our Git repository is structured to maintain different types of files and assets.
- The primary source code is hosted in a designated folder.

## 4. Branching and Merging Strategy
- We follow a branching and merging strategy to manage code changes.
- Code changes are merged into the main branch through pull requests.
- Merging is performed after code reviews and automated testing.

## 5. Code Review Process
- All code changes must go through a review process before merging.
- Code reviews are conducted using pull requests, and they are mandatory for all changes.
- Reviewers are assigned based on relevant expertise.
- Reviewers provide feedback, and changes are made iteratively until approval.
- Code is merged only after it is reviewed and approved.

## 6. Commit Messages and Documentation
- All commits must be accompanied by descriptive commit messages.
- Commit messages should follow a consistent format.
- Updated documentation is required when changes impact user documentation or system behavior.

## 7. Periodic Review and Improvement
- The source control strategy will be reviewed regularly for possible enhancements.
- Feedback from team members is encouraged and considered for strategy improvement.

## 8. Documentation and Communication
- Comprehensive documentation is maintained for the entire development process.
- Documentation covers code, notes, and agenda proposals.
- Effective communication channels are established through Discord to keep team members informed about important developments and changes.

## 9. Conclusion
Our source control strategy is essential for maintaining code quality, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring a streamlined development process. This strategy documentation serves as a reference for our team to follow and continuously improve our source control practices.
