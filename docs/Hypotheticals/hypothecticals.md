## Hypotheticals for Sprint 3
**Team**
You will find the `Comp_Arch.md` and `process_model.md` files in the hypotheticals where the tasks defined have not been finished due to late feedback:
- agenda coverage for each meeting: We would have been more clear about the meeting agenda after getting this feedback. It was too late to incorporate
- includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class diary/webpage: We thought some of the agenda items are suggestions for our meetings and we often talk outside class time. We would have done this better for sprint 3.
- New tasks and issues arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on kanban board: We would have got further clarification on this and improved clarity of tasks being moved to backlog for improvements. We felt like we were doing a good job of this.
  (Prof feedback: _don't see much from reviews. How are review issues handled?_)
- Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness: Since the beginning we had trouble with understanding code reviews. We didn't know how to properly do them but with this feedback we would have got further clarification and incorporated more guidelines into our code reviews.
  (Prof feedback: _not so much on the guidelines and decoupling, but I see use of the regression tests_)
- Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests: (Feedback from professor: I don't think rendering is depicted accurately. You should include the external package elements in your architecture where they play an important role (templating)
Represent the API appropriately.) We believed that our component architecture document was perfectly written and with accordance to the API the document provided well representations of the interfaces of the architecture. We are unable to further understand where the rendering went wrong and how to actually include external packages for the templating.
Furthermore, we didn't know whether to update our component architecture to something completely different as we were supposed to modularize the code, which completely depended on how the component architecture was marked for the previous one and what the professor is expecting

- Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model: Jason would have added the outer cycle for this document.
  (Prof feedback: _would like to see this embedded in classic sprint approach discussion. (Where is the outer cycle?_)
