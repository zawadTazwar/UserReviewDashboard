## Hypotheticals of Md Golam Mahmud Chowdhury
**Individual**

These are the items that are not finished by me due to late feedback:

- Team architecture design document indicates how your interface design and code fits into the overall project components:
The module clearly indicated that the session management was the part that I did and is specified to manage sessions for the application after authenticating the user.
Though there was scope of improvement as stated by the instructor which wasn't mentioned in the feedback.
After the feedback was released I couldn't get the chance to discuss with the instructor to improve this part, so it remains as a job undone in my hypothetical.  

- Unit tests are correct and working (not necessarily passing) for public interface methods/services of your design components and coding tasks, sufficient to test a correct mode and incorrect mode for different method invocations:
I had provided unit tests for all the functions but still got 6/10; Can't really tell where it has gone wrong; a feedback sooner would have given me time to resolve it

- Docstrings are complete and appropriate for all modules and public interface elements of your design components and coding tasks:
Provided all the docstrings on my behalf, but there might be something wrong with the format, for which I required some guidance

- Code component shows consideration of SOLID, de-coupling, common patterns (Adapter) and other code style and standards applied as appropriate:
Couldn't decipher the missing patterns that could have made it more perfect; early feedback would have me act sooner.

- Task completion with finished working code and attributions table:
My code is working and I finished it for the last sprint, but still couldn't understand why I scored less.
Also, filled the attributions table, but don't understand where I might have gone wrong.
