**Time:** 1PM  
**Attendance:** Everyone

Reviewed the coding assignments given to everyone at the previous meeting. However, Dayeem had informed us prior to the
meeting that he ran into a problem which he has described in the error report below:

Incident Description:
On 26 Oct. 2023, while working on my branch of our project's repository, I inadvertently committed to the main branch of
the repository.
Immediate Actions Taken:
Upon discovering the unintended code modifications, I took the following immediate actions:
Acknowledgment: I immediately acknowledged the error and notified the team about the situation.

Branch Isolation: To prevent further damage, I stopped making any additional changes to the branch.

Revert to Previous Commit: I performed a Git reset to revert the branch to the previous commit, which was known to be in
a stable state as well.

Moving on, we discussed how we will employ UML diagrams for the module interfaces for this sprint. 
Everyone advised to review the professors video concerning said issue and to have sufficient knowledge on the matter, so
that it can be implemented in the next meeting. Further, we discussed issues everyone had been encountering with their assignments and
helped each other understand how to fix these. Kanban board also to be updated with new issues. Goal until next meeting is to complete whatever 
tasks followed through to sprint 2 from sprint 1.

Agenda items from professor: Reviewing feedback for sprint 1 and incorporating it into our process model moving forward.
Kanban board is used for coding and design tasks only. We only want to see the progress of each individuals assigned 
tasks in there. We will document decisions and problems in the meeting notes and we will update how those problems are 
going in the meeting notes.

Code reviews have been happening in discord and we were not documenting them properly for how the professor wants us to
complete them. We will now have a codereview.md file that we will update when doing pull requests.

Due date for comment code and search bar code pushed to Nov. 3. Team was struggling with finding out how to implement 
these features and needed more time to do so. This was okay because we are ahead of schedule for deadline of sprint 2.

We also talked about how our server.py file is very disorganized. To solve said issue we are going to organize it better 
with proper docstrings for each piece of code. This issue has also been highlighted in the kanban board.
Furthermore, the modules being worked upon by each member were difficult to identify according to the professor, so we 
are going to properly indicate in the readme file which part of code belongs to which individual.

#### New Features
We add some new things to our backlog. After reviewing code and brainstorming we decided we wanted to only show the log out button when you are logged in. We also only want to show the reviews page when logged in. 
Another feature added to the backlog was to update view_review to display the username of the user who created the review.

#### Code Reviews
We have been doing code reviews in our discord group chat. We find this is the most efficient way for us to do them. It allows our group members to look at the code when they can. 
We will create a code reviews markdown file showing discord discussions. Jason is working on taking the info from discord and updating the file for marking. We will take our code review process and put it in a format similar to the example given on the course webpage for better understanding. 
This format seems to be better for how we should go about code reviews and will be the format going forward.

#### What we are working on now
We are now putting our finishing touches on likes/dislikes and the rating review. The due date is tonight for those tasks. 
The rest of the week, we will be finalizing the documents for marking, the kanban board for the backlog, performance reviews, readme file, and more.

#### Old Tasks
For the search bar, the coding task for md has not been submitted yet. He never communicated any issues or anything about why it was behind over the weekend. 
So we communicated in the meeting that we needed things done on time and to ask for help if he needed it. We will check back into this issue for next due date to make sure this problem has been solved. 
Everything else was completed for Nov. 3 deadline.

#### Process Model and Architecture Document
This was our rough idea of a process model while in the meeting today. We are going to discuss more outside of class and update what we came up with in the next meeting notes.
_Figure out process model description in meeting today:_
* **Process now:** Understand sprint instructions -> team meeting -> work on assigned tasks -> review finished work -> find ways to improve -> add to backlog -> back to team meeting -> once we finished primary tasks, do backlog tasks. Create this as a diagram and then explain how we do each item of the diagram.

Ask about the component architecture document. Is it just the UML diagram but more detailed? 
* Info we got was to look into the UML video. Create a diagram based on our architecture and explain each component.

#### Unit Tests
Unit tests are still an issue, we don't understand how to create them and have been testing our code manually. We talked to the process and got some insight from one of his videos
We are going to try it out and hopefully have something working soon. If not we will go back to the professor for more help.
