Reviewed the coding assignments given to everyone at the previous meeting. However, Dayeem had informed us prior to the
meeting that he ran into a problem which he has described in the error report below:

Incident Description:
On 26 Oct. 2023, while working on my branch of our project's repository, I inadvertently committed to the main branch of
the repository.
Immediate Actions Taken:
Upon discovering the unintended code modifications, I took the following immediate actions:
Acknowledgment: I immediately acknowledged the error and notified the team about the situation.

Branch Isolation: To prevent further damage, I stopped making any additional changes to the branch.

Revert to Previous Commit: I performed a Git reset to revert the branch to the previous commit, which was known to be in
a stable state as well.

Moving on, we discussed how we will employ UML diagrams for the module interfaces for this sprint. 
Everyone advised to review the professors video concerning said issue and to have sufficient knowledge on the matter, so
that it can be implemented in the next meeting. Further, we discussed issues everyone had been encountering with their assignments and
helped each other understand how to fix these. Goal until next meeting is to complete whatever tasks followed through to sprint 2 from sprint 1.
