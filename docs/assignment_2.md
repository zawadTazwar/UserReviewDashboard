# Assignment 2 , CS2005 F2023

This outlines activities that will be evaluated for assignment 2 - the second development cycle / sprint - of the project.
Specific advice on detailed activities and to be undertaken will be posted under meeting agendas corresponding to classroom
sessions on the course web page. They may not be complete during the meeting, but they should be discussed and
assigned with an expected completion time during team meetings. The team should also undertake their own agenda items 
(code reviews, design activity, and so on) during team meetings.

Your team sprint should undertake completion of any tasks or features not completed in sprint 1, in addition to new features and tasks. 

The following software features should be undertaken as objectives of the second sprint:

* _**session management**_ Provides that multiple users can be logged in and operating the app at the same time. The information from different sessions does not get mixed up by the application.
* _**search**_ Review entries can be found with partial match searches of users or topics 
* _**rating review**_ A team should have the option of creating and including a series of rating items as part of a review. This may require the creation of new data structures for the app logic. As an example, a team might want to use these rating items in a review:
<div style="padding: 50px; margin: 10px 80px; border: solid;">
Rate the following on a scale from 1 to 10:  <br><br>
<input type="number" min="1" max="10"> Effort expended on this topic.   <br>
<input type="number" min="1" max="10"> Communication with team.   <br>
<input type="number" min="1" max="10"> Participation in critical reviews.   <br>
<input type="number" min="1" max="10"> Attending team meetings.   <br>
</div>
* a feature for automating aggregation of rating reviews and/or quantitative analysis based on rating reviews should be added to your project backlog (i.e. it does not need to be implemented in this sprint).

Your team should also implement an _**additional two features**_ of their own choice. They can be drawn from user stories, kanban backlog, and/or suggestions solicited from team members or others.

Each team member should be assigned a minimum of two coding tasks for this sprint.  Less than 40 lines of new code from a team member (for all their code contributions) will be considered insufficient individual effort for the second sprint, so you may need to add additional features or coding tasks.

A grading scheme for sprint 2 will be posted in due course.
