# Code Review and Improvement Plan

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive review of the existing codebase and outlines a plan for improvements. The code is a simple web application built with Bottle, allowing users to sign up, log in, create and view reviews. However, there are several key areas for improvement to enhance security, functionality, and the overall user experience. All of these have been discussed at previous meetings and will hopefully, be implemented in future sprints.

### 1. User Review Management
- **Issue**: The code lacks functionality for users to view, edit, or delete the reviews they have added.
- **Plan**: Implement routes and functions to enable users to manage their reviews, including viewing, editing, and deleting their own reviews.

### 2. Password Hashing
- **Issue**: Passwords are stored in plain text, posing a significant security risk.
- **Plan**: Implement password hashing using a library like bcrypt to securely store user passwords.

### 3. Session Management
- **Issue**: The code lacks proper session management, allowing users to access the dashboard without authentication.
- **Plan**: Integrate a session management library (e.g., Beaker) to handle user sessions securely, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the dashboard.

### 4. Code Structure and Separation
- **Issue**: The code is structured in a single file, which can hinder code maintainability.
- **Plan**: Organize the code into different files or modules for better organization. Separate routes, templates, and utility functions for improved code structure.

### 5. Improved HTML Templates
- **Issue**: The HTML templates can be improved for a better user experience and design.
- **Plan**: Enhance the look and feel of the application by using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or by designing more appealing templates.

### 6. Data Validation
- **Issue**: Lack of input validation exposes the application to security vulnerabilities.
- **Plan**: Add input validation to ensure user inputs are sanitized and secure. Validate email addresses and sanitize user-generated content to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### 7. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Proper error handling is lacking, which can leave users confused when errors occur.
- **Plan**: Implement error handling with user-friendly error messages to guide users when issues arise.

### 8. Database Interaction
- **Issue**: The code lacks error handling for database interactions, which can result in unexpected behavior.
- **Plan**: Implement error handling for database interactions to handle potential issues, such as database connection errors.

### 9. Use Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Sensitive information like the MongoDB connection string is hard-coded in the code.
- **Plan**: Store sensitive information like connection strings in environment variables or a configuration file for better security and flexibility.

### 10. Comment Clarity
- **Issue**: Some comments could provide more context about what specific functions or code sections are doing.
- **Plan**: Improve comment clarity to enhance code understanding for future developers.

### 11. Logging
- **Plan**: Implement logging to record errors and application events for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Conclusion
The code review and improvement plan outlined in this document provides a roadmap for enhancing the security, functionality, and user experience of the existing web application. By addressing these issues and making the recommended improvements, the code can be transformed into a more robust and user-friendly application.
